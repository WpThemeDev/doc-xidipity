<h2>Advance Classes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aln:text-center fnt:family-mono fnt:size-small sm)fnt:size-large">environment[media)property:value!event]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of Advance CSS classes is to provide a method whereby authors or web developers can extend the functionality and styling of Xidipity templates. Although Advance classes may resemble a CSS framework, they are limited in scope to enhance performance. The goal of the syntax is to make their use intuitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>environment</h2>
<h6>print</h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbreviation:</span> prt</p>
<p>The print environment is content formatted for printing. This environment is supported by the "sys/print-var(css)" and the "theme/print(css)" files. The default assumption is print output will be monochrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>web</h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbreviation:</span> web</p>
<p>The web environment is content formatted for devices with a screen. This is the default environment and only needs to be specified in limited circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>editor</h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbreviation:</span> mce</p>
<p>The editor environment is a subset of the web environment with adjustments made to enhance content creation. Like the web environment, it only needs to be specified in limited circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>media</h2>
<p>Within the web environment content needs to be responsive and format appropriately to the device of the user. This is referred to as responsiveness.  Xidipity is fully responsive and uses a design language which supports mobile first. In addition, Xidipity supports all other screens dimensions under the pseudonym "sm" which means standard media.  The default assumption is the class will be applied to all unless prefixed with "sm)".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>property</h2>
<p>This refers to the property of the HTML element you want to style. In the example below "text-align" and "color" are properties of the HTML paragraph element "&lt;p&gt;".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>p {<br />  text-align: center;<br />  color: red;<br />}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>value</h2>
<p>The property's value is the <abbr>css</abbr> style to be applied. In the example above, the property value "center" instructs the browser to center (align) the content between the paragraph tags. Classes are often composed of multiple properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>event</h2>
<p><abbr>CSS</abbr> recognizes several events. Examples include "hover", "focus", and "active". Xidipity supports hover and focus. Styling can be targeted to an event such as changing the background color when the cursor moves over the element.</p>
