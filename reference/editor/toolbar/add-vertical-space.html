                Single space insert is not required as this is achieved by pressing the [return] key. Vertical space is tinted in the editor as a visual clue of its presence. The tint is not displayed on the web. If the desire becomes to remove the spacing, place the cursor before the first character following the space and press the delete or backspace key.
